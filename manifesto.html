    <h1>🔗 AAX – Founding Manifesto</h1>
    <p><em>Version 1.0 – July 2025</em></p>

    <h2>🌐 Why AAX?</h2>
    <p>
      The internet was designed for humans to interact with information. But in
      this new age, we need infrastructure for humans to act through intelligent
      agents—safely, transparently, and with dignity.
    </p>

    <h2>🤖 What is AAX?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Agent Action eXchange (AAX)</strong> is a protocol and digital
      standard that allows authorized AI agents to perform actions on the
      web—such as <code>pay</code>, <code>book</code>, or <code>cancel</code>—in
      a secure, structured, and human-approved manner.
    </p>

    <h2>🔐 Core Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        💡 <strong>Consent First:</strong> No action without clear human
        approval.
      </li>
      <li>
        📜 <strong>Traceability:</strong> All actions are signed and logged.
      </li>
      <li>
        🛑 <strong>Reversibility:</strong> Actions can be reversed or disputed.
      </li>
      <li>
        🤝 <strong>Trust by Design:</strong> Agents must identify and verify
        themselves.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧬 Agent Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Each agent has a verifiable <code>agent_id</code> and uses digital
      signatures to prove authorization. Actions are executed using a structured
      file called <code>.agent.json</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>💳 AgentPay</h2>
    <p>
      Our vision includes an AI-first payment gateway, enabling secure,
      tokenized transactions initiated by agents but always approved by humans.
    </p>

    <h2>📣 Call to Innovators</h2>
    <p>
      This is just the beginning. We invite developers, researchers, and ethical
      technologists to build on this foundation and ensure that the next
      evolution of the web is truly human-centered.
